 # CNN Feature Visualizations
 
 This reposetorires contains an implementation of feature visualization and a nudged elastic band algorithm, which is used to produce short video clips of different features.
 Some resulst are depiceted under <https://niioon.github.io/CNN_Visualizations/>
 
 Have look at [NEB_Visualization.ipynb](NEB_Visualization.ipynb) for the implementation of feature visualization and the NEB algorithm.
 
 [visualize_with_lucid.ipynb](visualize_with_lucid.ipynb) contains code for visualizaztions using the lucid library.
 
 [create_lucid_model.ipynb](create_lucid_model.ipynb) trasnforms a keras model to a lucid model.
 
 If anyones interested, heres my bachelor thesis about feature visualization.
